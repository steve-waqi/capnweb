// Implements a test RPC backend server for tests to try connecting to.
//
// This is intended to be used as a vitest `globalSetup`. That means this strictly runs under Node.
// That's OK:
// - Browsers can't be servers anyway, so it's fine if they only get tested as clients.
// - For workerd tests specifically, we can test the server side by using a service binding to
//   test Worker (test-server-workerd.js). This means the workerd server code is only exercised by
//   the workerd tests, not by any other client, but that's fine as the protocol should be
//   identical regardless.
